## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview 
This is a fullstack messaging app built using Clean Architecture principles. It features custom dependency injection, secure JWT authentication, real-time messaging with Socket.IO, and persistent logging for application monitoring in production. It offers features like friend requests, real-time chat, user status tracking, and live updates.

The frontend leverages React, TypeScript, Jotai for state management, and Vite for fast development, delivering a modern, responsive UI with light/dark theme support. The backend follows a layered structure (routes ‚Üí controllers ‚Üí services ‚Üí repositories) and includes custom logging and middleware for validation, authentication, and error handling, with MongoDB for data storage

The frontend and backend are deployed separately (Vercel / Railway), and the project supports both local and Docker-based containerized development environments. The app is live [here](https://messaging-app-client-ebon.vercel.app/).

## üöÄ Installation and Development

### üñ•Ô∏è Client Folder
`npm install`
<br/>`npm run dev`

### üîß Server Folder
`npm install`
<br/>`npm start`



### or

## üê≥ Docker Development Environment(Optional)

This project supports fully containerized development using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), enabling minimal local environment setup.
From the root folder, you can run both the client and server with a single command: `npm run docker:start`. 
<br/> <sub>Note: The local files are mounted into the containers, so any changes made locally will automatically be reflected inside the container, with live reload enabled.</sub>

### üìã Details
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Uses Jotai for state management (a more modern alternative to Redux)
- Implements responsive design with light/dark theme support
- Features comprehensive UI components for messaging, friend requests, and user authentication
- Structured code organization with proper separation of concerns

Backend (Node.js + Express)
- Express server with RESTful API endpoints
- MongoDB integration with proper repository patterns
- JWT authentication with refresh token mechanism
- Socket.io implementation for real-time communication
- Dependency injection

Security Implementations
- JWT with separate access and refresh tokens for enhanced security
- Password hashing with bcrypt using salt rounds
- Token versioning mechanism for invalidation (preventing reuse of old tokens)
- Comprehensive auth middleware with error handling

Architecture
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Service layer for business logic encapsulation
- Controller layer handling API endpoints
- Proper error handling and status codes

Features
- User authentication with signup/login workflows
- Friend request system with accept/reject functionality
- Real-time messaging with message status indicators(Currently in progress)
- User online status tracking
- Responsive UI that works across device sizes

## üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture Implementation
This project follows Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture principles:

- **Interface Layer**: Controllers and routes that handle HTTP requests
- **Application Layer**: Services that coordinate domain actions
- **Repository Layer**: External concerns like databases and messaging

The architecture employs the Dependency Inversion Principle, ensuring high-level modules don't depend on low-level implementations. Key architectural features include:

- **NotificationService**: Abstracts all real-time communication, decoupling controllers from Socket.IO
- **Strong boundary enforcement**: Each layer has a clear responsibility
- **Dependency injection**: Services receive their dependencies rather than creating them
- **Loose coupling**: Components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations

## üíª Real-time Communication
- Socket.IO implementation with clean architectural separation
- Centralized notification system for consistent real-time events
- Proper handling of user connection/disconnection events
- Live status updates for friends
- Real-time message delivery with typing indicators

## üîÆ Future Enhancements(Coming in the future)
- Enhanced notifications and real-time features
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Additional profile features
- Group chat functionality
- Voice and video calling features
